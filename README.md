# SoftWare-Design-Project-Proposal
In order to test and run this project, I created this sketch on wokwi.com: https://wokwi.com/projects/357324487532914689
All of the files included in this repository are also in that project, except for the diagram.json file. To get the project running, you just have have to replace the code in the diagram.json in wokwi sketch with the code from the diagram.json in this repository. After that, hitting the green start button on the will begin a small snake game that can be controlled with the joystick. One thing that is important to note is that, at the moment, the y-axis is switched but that is something that could be easily fixed once we started working on project.
